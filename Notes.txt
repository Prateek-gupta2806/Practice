CALL BACK HELL:- When there are callbakcs inside callbakcs it is called as callback hell. Nested callbacks. 
TO solve call back hell we have a tool named promises.


Promise :- Can be pending, resolved and Rejected.

If a promise is fullfilled we have to get a task done. I.E success message


Beautiful example of promise chaining.
Async function alaways retunrs a promise.

IIFE:- executes the code automatically. Used genrally when we have 
to call a function once. a function which is immediately invoked.
