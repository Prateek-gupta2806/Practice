CALL BACK HELL:- When there are callbakcs inside callbakcs it is called as callback hell. Nested callbacks. 
TO solve call back hell we have a tool named promises.


Promise :- Can be pending, resolved and Rejected.

If a promise is fullfilled we have to get a task done. I.E success message


Beautiful example of promise chaining.
Async function alaways retunrs a promise.

IIFE:- executes the code automatically. Used genrally when we have 
to call a function once. a function which is immediately invoked.




API CALLING NOTES :- 

API stands for Application Programming Interface.

In simple words, it's like a waiter in a restaurant.
You (the customer) look at the menu (the available features).
You tell the waiter (API) what you want.
The waiter goes to the kitchen (the system or server) and brings back the food (data or result).
You don't need to know how the kitchen worksâ€”you just get what you asked for.


ðŸ”¹ In Tech Terms:
APIs let two software systems talk to each other.
You can send a request and get a response.
It hides all the complex stuff behind the scenes.

API calls work on response and Request. status = 200 means everything ok.
